How do I attend a workshop?

Can I join a workshop organized by someone else?

Do you organize independent workshops?

Is your workshop free?

> Sorry, it's not. We need some money to organize and get our trainers/stuff. Please check out the rates above.

Can I get a discount?

What if I am not satisfied with your workshop?
