We depend on highly educated and experienced experts to produce content and deliver our workshops and training programs. They are from different pedigree and walks of life.

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left](http://www.tutorialboard.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/facebook-icon-150x150.png){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!
