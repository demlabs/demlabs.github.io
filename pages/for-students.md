## Be our Dark Knight in your campus

According to legend, the Night's Watch was founded in the Game of Thrones. They now protect the fraternity of Engineers from threats, such as ignorance, lack of interest and opportunity, boring syllabus, lack of emphasis on practical or research knowledge and last but not the least “the race” for job.

They man a huge family of unfocused species known as the Engineers, residing within the safe walls of their big castles known as Engg. Colleges. They also regulate and circulate resources and news from the DEM-labs, from which they obtain regular free guidance, information material, knowledge-ware and other provisions. This privilege can be claimed by any enthusiast who sworns in the [sacred oath](https://demlabs.github.io/dark-knights/) to safeguard the engineering fraternity till his last breathe.
