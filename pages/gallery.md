###### Testimonials

The best thing about the workshop was
- In short, everything
- The presentation
- The career scope presented
- Real life examples of good and bad design
- The motivation to learn software, its value in industries 
- Primarily the content. The zeal that was imbibed to take up Computational Analysis/Mechanics as a career option. Different avenues for learning stuffs. 
- Examples were nice. The workshop holds the ability to intrigue imagination in one's mind. 
- The information about different the softwares used by mechanical engineers to do their jobs. 
- Presenter was quite good  and his way of presenting is lucid.

The worst thing about the workshop was
- workshop was compressed to 4 hours
- There was no bad thing about the workshop. Being a final year student I suggest that these kind of workshops should happen more often and during the initial years.
- Time constraint.
- It was above my expectation level. The only thing I wish there should be is  more time, or a more detailed version.
- Overall, the content was excellent. We got an overview of the global scenario. But what was missing was a little content related to FEM and co-related things. Yes, there were time constraints but next time the bigger, the better!!
- Lack of software training, of course it was due to the lack of time.
