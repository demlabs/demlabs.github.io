### Testimonials

The best things about the workshop were {everything, content and presentation, career scope presented, real life examples of good and bad design, motivation to learn software and its value in industries, the zeal that was imbibed to take up Computational Analysis/Mechanics as a career option, different avenues for learning stuffs, the workshop holds the ability to intrigue imagination in one's mind, the information about different the softwares used by mechanical engineers to do their jobs, presenter was quite good  and his way of presenting is lucid.}

The worst thing about the workshop was {workshop was compressed to 4 hours, there was no bad thing about the workshop. Being a final year student I suggest that these kind of workshops should happen more often and during the initial years, it was above my expectation level, the only thing I wish there should be is  more time, or a more detailed version, overall, the content was excellent. We got an overview of the global scenario. But what was missing was a little content related to FEM and co-related things. Yes, there were time constraints but next time the bigger, the better!!, lack of software training, of course it was due to the lack of time.}
