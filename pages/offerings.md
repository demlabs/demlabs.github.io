title: What Do We Offer
permalink: /offerings/
---

We offer courses on new product development using computational tools such as finite element analysis, CAD, and computational fluid dynamics etc. Our courses are customized for a specific audience to tune them as per their expectation and understanding. This is what differentiates us from just another workshop organizing company. We also offer perspectives on building a career in product development.

We are backed by experts from all walks of elite pedigree, be it industry or academia. 

By the end of the workshop, every candidate is ready with a video showing their work. They can show it off to company people or create an online portfolio supporting their work.

## Asking the Right Questions

We believe in the **three elements of a good candidate - Attitude + Skills + Knowledge or ASK**. We plant the seed for all of them through the workshop and mentor them forward with special sessions and courses later. They develop these qualities and start to **ASK** the right questions.

**Knowledge:** We impart the most practical, industry and research oriented knowledge base to the candidates which are difficult to impart in a regular classroom. Over-loaded teachers are not to blame as the world is fast moving and the duty of teachers ranges from teaching basics to exposure of advanced topics. 

**Skills:** Software and programming skills are a must for working in industry and research. We walk the students through a highly optimal process devised by experts to learn and use them in different case studies illustrated in the workshop.

**Attitude:** The knowldge and process of learning imparted gives the students a good judgement on their capabilities and they can change their attitude from "*This is too difficult to learn*" to "*If I can find the good resources and guidance, I can learn anything.*" This gives them an edge over others and they can implement it in major projects and internships. We keep a lot of free resources in this website too.
