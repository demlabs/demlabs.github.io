## The Story of DEM Labs

### What is the issue?

**India Today:** *Only 7 per cent engineering graduates employable: What's wrong with India's engineers?* [^1]

**Times of India:** *Over 80% of engineering graduates in India unemployable: Study.* [^2]

**Economic Times:** *A million engineers in India struggling to get placed in an extremely challenging market.* [^3]

**Youth ki awaaz:** *Why Is India Producing Unemployable Engineers?* [^4]

These news reports are not all gimmicks, infact they are based on an employability-focused study based on 150,000 engineering students who graduated in 2013([Report in PDF](http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%20Annual%20Report%202016.pdf)), conducted by [Aspiring Minds](http://www.aspiringminds.com/), A New Delhi-based employment solutions company. This survey resulted in some shocking stats.

Why this happens? What is root cause of these issues? Is our engineering education so bad or there are other issues cripling the not-so-top-tier engineering colleges? Since the engineering syllabus of all colleges are the same, why such stark differences are observed. 

We went deep into these:

- Low-tier engineering colleges don't have the appropriate level of industry interaction
- They don't have the support of a diverse alumni network
- They don't have the government aided infrastructure to provide extraordinary facilities such as IISc/IITs
- Industries want to play it safe and interact with only the top-tier institutions

The growing number of these findings had become our main topic of discussion for last several years. During one such session we unanimously stumbled upon this idea of Design Engineering and Management Lab(DEM Lab). Any contribution which we can make to help our engineering students would make us more than happy.

Brainstorming about these issues tell us that, many of these issues can be solved by increasing industry-academia interactions which is not always easy given the 

- bureaucratic nature to achieve and implement such memoranda of understanding
- lack of enthusiasm from companies to amalgamate with anything other than top-tier engineering colleges
- lack of local opportunites in many engineering institutions

### How we are solving these issues

- We don't have a long list of requirements and understandings in order to collaborate. Once the institutions agree, our collaborators sign an MoU, take a pre-survey, and deliver the required training within a month or so after negotiating for time with the experts. The one and only roadblock is getting the time from our experts.
- We don't care about your reputations. Many of our experts come from unknown institutions and has achieved excellence through hard work, grabbing opportunities, and appropriate guidance.
- We have local collaborators in many different states(and growing). We bring the best of elite institutions and esteemed organizations to your doorstep through out panel of experts.
- We are providing these expertise which helps the students emulate the behavior, work ethics, and resourcefullness of our mentors. They indirectly becomes the guiding support and complement the academic know-how already provided by the faculty.
