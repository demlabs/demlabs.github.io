We are a group of engineers from IITs/IISc/NITs and we want to complement your engineering education using our experiences.

## How and Why DEM-Labs? 

Here goes the story:

**India Today:** *Only 7 per cent engineering graduates employable: What's wrong with India's engineers?* [^1]

**Times of India:** *Over 80% of engineering graduates in India unemployable: Study.* [^2]

**Economic Times:** *A million engineers in India struggling to get placed in an extremely challenging market.* [^3]

**Youth ki awaaz:** *Why Is India Producing Unemployable Engineers?* [^4]

An employability-focused study based on 150,000 engineering students who graduated in 2013([Report in PDF](http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%20Annual%20Report%202016.pdf)), conducted by Aspiring Minds, A New Delhi-based employment solutions company, found some shocking stats.

As many as 97 per cent of graduating engineers want jobs either in software engineering or core engineering. However, only 3 per cent have suitable skills to be employed in software or product market, and only 7 per cent can handle core engineering tasks.

The growing number of these findings had become our main topic of discussion for last several years. During one such session we unanimously stumbled upon this idea of Design Engineering and Management Lab(DEM Lab). Any contribution which we can make to help our engineering students would make us more than happy.

Brainstorming about these issues tell us that, many of these issues can be solved by increasing industry-academia interactions which is not always easy given the 

- bureaucratic nature to achieve and implement such memoranda of understanding
- lack of enthusiasm from companies to amalgamate with anything other than top-tier engineering colleges
- lack of local opportunites in many engineering institutions

### How we are solving these issues

- We don't have a long list of requirements and understandings. Once the institutions agree, our collaborators sign an MoU, take a pre-survey, and deliver the required training within a month or so after negotiating for time with the experts.
- We don't care about your reputations. Many of our experts come from unknown colleges and has achieved excellence through hard work, grabbing opportunities, and appropriate guidance.
- We have local collaborators in many different states(and growing). We bring the best of elite institutions and esteemed organizations to your doorstep through out panel of experts.
